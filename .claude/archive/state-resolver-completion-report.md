# State Resolver Fixes - Completion Report

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Work Duration:** 8 iterations (multiple rounds of ChatGPT review)
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Historical Document)

> **Note:** This document captures the state at completion (2026-01-13). The test suite has since grown to 198+ tests as additional features were added. The architecture and design decisions remain accurate.

## Overview

Comprehensively fixed session state detection logic through iterative external AI review. Started with 4 identified issues, expanded to 6 issues through rigorous analysis, resulting in battle-tested resolver logic.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Root Path Handling
- **Before:** Root only matched immediate children (`/` ↔ `/foo` only, not `/foo/bar`)
- **After:** Root matches any absolute path descendant (`/` ↔ `/a/b/c/d`)
- **Why:** `format!("{}/", "/")` produced `"//"` which broke pattern matching

### 2. Sibling Matching Contamination
- **Before:** Supported sibling matching with depth >= 2 guard
- **After:** Removed sibling matching entirely
- **Why:** Depth guards can't prevent `/Users/me/proj1` ↔ `/Users/me/proj2` cross-contamination with PID reuse

### 3. PID-Only Lock Selection
- **Before:** Returned first lock matching PID (nondeterministic)
- **After:** Returns newest lock by ISO timestamp comparison
- **Why:** Locks accumulate on cd - newest represents current location

### 4. Exact Lock Exclusion
- **Before:** PID-only search only checked child locks (`path.starts_with(prefix)`)
- **After:** Checks both exact and child locks
- **Why:** Prefix `/project/` doesn't match exact lock at `/project`

### 5. Test Validation
- **Before:** All locks created with same timestamp (didn't validate selection)
- **After:** `create_lock_with_timestamp()` helper with explicit timestamps
- **Why:** Tests must prove timestamp-based selection works

### 6. Documentation Accuracy
- **Before:** Docstrings mentioned removed sibling matching
- **After:** Updated to reflect three-way matching (exact/child/parent)
- **Why:** Stale documentation misleads future changes

## Final Architecture

### Match Types (Priority Order)

```rust
enum MatchType {
    Parent = 0,  // record.cwd is parent of lock (cd .. scenario)
    Child = 1,   // record.cwd is child of lock (cd subdir scenario)
    Exact = 2,   // exact match - highest priority
}
```

### Selection Priority

1. **Freshness** (record.updated_at) - always wins first
2. **Match Type** (Exact > Child > Parent) - if timestamps equal
3. **Session ID** (lexicographic) - if timestamps and match types equal

### Root Special-Casing

```rust
if lock_path_normalized == "/" {
    // Any absolute path is descendant of /
    if record_cwd_normalized.starts_with("/") && record_cwd_normalized != "/" {
        Some(MatchType::Child)
    }
}
```

### Lock Selection with Timestamp

```rust
// Collect all matching locks (exact + children)
// Select newest by created timestamp
if info.created > current.created {
    best_match = Some(info);
}
```

## Test Coverage

**At completion:** 94 tests (now 198+ tests)

**Key Tests:**
- `test_root_cd_to_nested_path()` - Root to arbitrary depth
- `test_nested_path_cd_to_root()` - Nested depth back to root
- `test_multi_lock_cd_scenario()` - Timestamp-based selection validated
- `test_resolver_uses_session_id_as_stable_tiebreaker()` - Deterministic tie-breaking

**Removed:** 3 sibling tests (feature removed)
**Added:** 2 root nesting tests (new capability)

## Trade-offs

### Advantages
- ✅ **No cross-project contamination** - sibling matching removed
- ✅ **Deterministic behavior** - timestamp-based, no HashMap iteration dependency
- ✅ **Root nesting works** - arbitrary depth from `/` supported
- ✅ **PID reuse safe** - considers exact locks, picks newest by timestamp
- ✅ **Well-tested** - comprehensive coverage of edge cases

### Limitations
- ❌ **cd ../sibling won't match** - sessions that cd to sibling directories won't be detected until they cd back to parent or original path
- **Acceptable:** Safety over convenience. User can manually check sibling directories if needed.

## Lessons Learned

### Process
- **External AI review highly effective** - 8 rounds found issues that wouldn't have been caught otherwise
- **Iterative refinement works** - each round improved robustness
- **Test coverage crucial** - edge cases only emerged through comprehensive testing

### Technical
- **Depth guards don't prevent contamination** - need project-level identifiers for sibling matching
- **Timestamp comparison works well** - ISO strings compare lexicographically
- **Root requires special-casing** - `/` doesn't fit normal prefix patterns
- **HashMap iteration is nondeterministic** - must not rely on order

### Documentation
- **Keep docs in sync** - stale comments mislead future changes
- **Test what you claim** - timestamp selection wasn't validated until round 8
- **ADRs capture rationale** - "why" is more valuable than "what"

## Future Considerations

### If Sibling Matching Needed Later

Requires one of:
1. **Project-level identifiers** - explicit project boundaries (e.g., git root detection)
2. **User configuration** - `.claude/hud.json` lists project directories
3. **Lock metadata** - include project ID in lock file

Without project boundaries, sibling matching will always risk cross-project PID reuse contamination.

### Root Path Edge Cases

Current implementation assumes:
- All absolute paths start with `/` (Unix-style)
- Root is exactly `/` (no `C:\` or other Windows roots)
- Path normalization preserves `/` for root

If supporting Windows or other path formats, root special-casing needs platform-specific logic.

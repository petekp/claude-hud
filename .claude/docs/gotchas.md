# Gotchas Reference

Detailed implementation gotchas for Capacitor development. See CLAUDE.md for the most common ones.

## Rust

### Formatting Required
CI enforces `cargo fmt`. Pre-commit hook catches this.

### dylib Copy After Rebuilds
After Rust rebuilds: `cp target/release/libhud_core.dylib apps/swift/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/`

### hud-hook Symlink (Not Copy)
Copying adhoc-signed Rust binaries to `~/.local/bin/` triggers macOS Gatekeeper SIGKILL (exit 137). Use symlink instead:
```bash
ln -s target/release/hud-hook ~/.local/bin/hud-hook
```
See `scripts/sync-hooks.sh`.

### hud-hook Must Point to Dev Build
During development, `~/.local/bin/hud-hook` must symlink to `target/release/hud-hook` (not app bundle) to pick up changes. After Rust changes: rebuild, verify symlink target. Stale hooks create stale locks.

### Logging Guard Must Be Held
`logging::init()` returns `Option<WorkerGuard>` which must be held in `main()` scope. Using `std::mem::forget()` prevents log flushing. See `logging.rs` and `main.rs:70`.

## Swift

### Never Use Bundle.module
Use `ResourceBundle.url(forResource:withExtension:)` instead—crashes in distributed builds.

### SwiftUI View Reuse
Use `.id(uniqueValue)` to force fresh instances for toasts/alerts.

### Swift 6 Concurrency
Views initializing `@MainActor` types need `@MainActor` on the view struct.

### Rust↔Swift Timestamps
Use custom decoder with `.withFractionalSeconds`. See `ShellStateStore.swift`.

### UniFFI Task Shadows Swift Task
UniFFI bindings define a `Task` type shadowing Swift's `_Concurrency.Task`. Always use `_Concurrency.Task` explicitly. Symptom: "cannot specialize non-generic type 'Task'" errors. Affected: `TerminalLauncher.swift`, `ShellStateStore.swift`.

### Activation Strategy Return Values
In `TerminalLauncher.swift`, strategy methods like `activateKittyRemote` must return actual success (not always `true`). Returning `true` unconditionally breaks the fallback chain.

## State & Locks

### Session-Based Locks (v4)
Locks keyed by `{session_id}-{pid}`, NOT path hash. Multiple concurrent sessions per directory allowed. Legacy MD5-hash locks (`{hash}.lock`) are stale—delete them. See `create_session_lock()` in `lock.rs`.

### Exact-Match Only for State Resolution
Lock and session matching uses exact path comparison. No child→parent inheritance. `/project/src` lock does NOT make `/project` active. Monorepo packages track independently.

### Diagnosing Stale Locks
Check `~/.capacitor/sessions/*.lock`. Session locks have UUID format. MD5-hash locks (32 hex chars) are legacy/stale. Use `ps -p {pid}` to verify lock holder.

### Focus Override Behavior
Manual override persists until clicking different project OR navigating to directory with active session. Navigating to project without session keeps focus (prevents timestamp racing). See `ActiveProjectResolver.swift`.

### Lock Dir Read Errors
`count_other_session_locks()` returns `usize::MAX` on I/O errors (not 0). Non-zero count preserves session record. Returning 0 would incorrectly tombstone active sessions. See `lock.rs:682-697`.

## Hooks

### Async Hooks Need Both Fields
Claude Code requires BOTH `"async": true` AND `"timeout": 30`. Missing either causes validation failure. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` for malformed entries. See `setup.rs:422-426`.

### Testing Unhealthy Hook States
App auto-repairs hooks at startup. Claude Code interactions keep heartbeat fresh. To test SetupStatusCard visibility:
1. Remove both `~/.local/bin/hud-hook` AND `apps/swift/.build/.../hud-hook` to prevent auto-repair, OR
2. Add `disableAllHooks: true` to `~/.claude/settings.json`

Heartbeat check returns `Healthy` if any active lock exists, even with stale heartbeat. See `check_hook_health()` in `engine.rs:782-787`.

## Activity Tracking

### Hook Format Detection in ActivityStore::load()
The activity store supports two formats: hook format (`"files"` array from hud-hook) and native format (`"activity"` array with `project_path`). When loading, the code checks for hook format markers before attempting native format parsing.

**Why this matters:** Hook format JSON successfully deserializes as native format (due to `serde(default)`), but with empty `activity` arrays. Without explicit hook marker detection, file activity data gets silently discarded, breaking the activity-based fallback for state resolution.

**Related test:** `loads_hook_format_with_boundary_detection` in `activity.rs`.

## Accepted Tradeoffs

### Cleanup Race Condition
`run_startup_cleanup()` uses read-modify-write without file locking. Concurrent hook events during cleanup could be lost. Accepted because: (1) cleanup runs only at app launch, (2) window is milliseconds, (3) lost events self-heal. See `cleanup.rs`.

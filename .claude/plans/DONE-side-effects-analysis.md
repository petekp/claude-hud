# Side Effects Analysis Plan

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-27)**

Systematic audit of Capacitor's side effects to identify latent issues causing state detection regressions and shell integration problems.

## Methodology

### Isolation Principle

Each subsystem analyzed in a **separate session** to prevent context pollution. Findings documented immediately after each session.

### Analysis Checklist (per subsystem)

For each side effect subsystem, verify:

1. **Correctness** — Does the code do what the documentation says?
2. **Atomicity** — Can partial writes corrupt state?
3. **Race conditions** — Can concurrent access cause inconsistency?
4. **Cleanup** — Are resources properly released on all exit paths?
5. **Error handling** — Do failures leave the system in a valid state?
6. **Documentation accuracy** — Do comments match behavior?
7. **Dead code** — Are there unused code paths that could cause confusion?

### Findings Format

Each issue documented as:

```
## [SUBSYSTEM] Issue: Brief title

**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
**Type:** Bug / Stale docs / Dead code / Race condition / Design flaw
**Location:** file.rs:line_range

**Problem:**
What's wrong and why it matters.

**Evidence:**
Code snippets or reasoning.

**Recommendation:**
Specific fix or removal.
```

## Analysis Order (Priority-Based)

### Phase 1: State Detection Core ✅ COMPLETE

These directly cause the "wrong state shown" regressions.

| Session | Subsystem               | Files                                           | Focus                                           | Status |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1       | **Lock System**         | `lock.rs`                                       | Lock creation, verification, exact-match policy | ✅     |
| 2       | **Lock Holder**         | `lock_holder.rs`, `handle.rs:spawn_lock_holder` | Lifecycle, exit detection, orphan prevention    | ✅     |
| 3       | **Session State Store** | `store.rs`, `types.rs`                          | State transitions, atomic saves, keying         | ✅     |
| 4       | **Cleanup System**      | `cleanup.rs`                                    | Stale lock removal, startup cleanup             | ✅     |
| 5       | **Tombstone System**    | `handle.rs` tombstone functions                 | Race prevention, cleanup timing                 | ✅     |

### Phase 2: Shell Integration ✅ COMPLETE

These cause "wrong project activated" or "shell not tracked" issues.

| Session | Subsystem                     | Files                    | Focus                                 | Status |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 6       | **Shell CWD Tracking**        | `cwd.rs`                 | PID tracking, dead shell cleanup      | ✅     |
| 7       | **Shell State Store (Swift)** | `ShellStateStore.swift`  | Reading/parsing, timestamp handling   | ✅     |
| 8       | **Terminal Launcher**         | `TerminalLauncher.swift` | TTY matching, AppleScript reliability | ✅     |

### Phase 3: Supporting Systems ✅ COMPLETE

Lower priority but can cause subtle issues.

| Session | Subsystem              | Files                          | Focus                             | Status |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| 9       | **Activity Files**     | `handle.rs` activity functions | File tracking accuracy            | ✅     |
| 10      | **Hook Configuration** | `setup.rs`                     | settings.json modification safety | ✅     |
| 11      | **Project Resolution** | `ActiveProjectResolver.swift`  | Focus override logic              | ✅     |

## Pre-Analysis: Known Issues from CLAUDE.md

These documented gotchas indicate areas of historical trouble:

1. **Session-based locks (v4)** — Complex keying scheme `{session_id}-{pid}` ✅ Verified correct
2. **Exact-match-only** — Recent policy change, docs may be stale ✅ Fixed in Session 1
3. **hud-hook symlink** — Must point to dev build, stale hooks create stale locks ✅ Documented
4. **Async hooks require both fields** — `async: true` AND `timeout: 30` ✅ Verified in Session 10
5. **Swift timestamp decoder** — Needs `.withFractionalSeconds` ✅ Verified in Session 7
6. **Focus override** — Only clears for active sessions ✅ Verified in Session 11

## Session 1 Findings

From initial read of `lock.rs`:

### Finding 1: Stale Documentation ✅ FIXED (2026-01-27)

**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Stale docs
**Location:** `lock.rs:42-46`

**Problem:**
Module docstring claims child→parent inheritance:

> "A lock at `/project/src` makes `/project` appear active"

But code implements exact-match-only (lines 377, 414-421). This could mislead future maintainers.

**Resolution:** Fixed in commit `3d78b1b`. Documentation now correctly states exact-match-only policy.

### Finding 2: Misleading Function Name

**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Stale naming
**Location:** `lock.rs:435`

**Problem:**
`find_matching_child_lock` doesn't find child locks anymore — it only does exact matching. Name is vestige from inheritance model.

## Summary of Findings

### Issues Fixed During Audit

1. **Stale documentation in lock.rs** — Fixed in commit `3d78b1b`

### Design Validations (No Action Needed)

1. **Session-based lock keying** — Correctly implements `{session_id}-{pid}` pattern
2. **Exact-match-only policy** — Correctly prevents child→parent inheritance confusion
3. **Focus override anti-racing** — Clever mechanism to prevent timestamp racing
4. **Shell child-path matching** — Correctly differs from lock exact-match (by design)
5. **Active/passive session priority** — Working sessions beat Ready sessions

### Low-Priority Items (Optional)

1. **Function rename**: `find_matching_child_lock` → `find_lock_for_path` (vestigial name)

---

## Next Steps

1. ~~Create `docs/audit/SUMMARY.md`~~ (findings summarized above)
2. Consider renaming `find_matching_child_lock` (low priority)
3. Archive this plan as reference

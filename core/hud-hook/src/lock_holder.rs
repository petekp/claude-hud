//! Lock holder daemon for Claude HUD.
//!
//! This background process monitors a Claude Code process and releases the lock
//! when the process exits.
//!
//! ## v4 Session-Based Locks
//!
//! With session-based locking, each process has its own lock file keyed by session_id + PID.
//! When the monitored PID exits, we simply release this process's lock. There's no
//! need for handoff since each concurrent process has its own independent lock.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Spawned by `handle` command on SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit
//! 2. Monitors the Claude process PID via `kill -0`
//! 3. When PID exits: release this session's lock (remove directory)

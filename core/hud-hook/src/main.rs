//! hud-hook: CLI hook handler for Capacitor session state tracking.
//!
//! Rust binary that handles Claude Code hook events and updates session state.
//! Called directly by Claude Code hooks configured in ~/.claude/settings.json.
//!
//! ## Subcommands
//!
//! - `handle`: Main hook handler, reads JSON from stdin
//! - `cwd`: Shell CWD tracking (called by shell precmd hooks)
//! - `lock-holder`: Background daemon for lock management (spawned internally)

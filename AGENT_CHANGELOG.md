# Agent Changelog

> This file helps coding agents understand project evolution, key decisions,
> and deprecated patterns. Updated: 2026-01-27

## Current State Summary

Capacitor is a native macOS SwiftUI app (Apple Silicon, macOS 14+) that acts as a sidecar dashboard for Claude Code. The architecture uses a Rust core (`hud-core`) with UniFFI bindings to Swift. State tracking relies on Claude Code hooks that write to `~/.capacitor/`, with session-based locks (`{session_id}-{pid}.lock`) as the authoritative signal for active sessions. Shell integration provides ambient project awareness via precmd hooks. Hooks run asynchronously to avoid blocking Claude Code execution. **New:** All file I/O uses `fs_err` for enriched error messages, and structured logging via `tracing` writes to `~/.capacitor/hud-hook-debug.{date}.log`.

## Stale Information Detected

None currently. Last audit: 2026-01-27 (fixed v3→v4 documentation in state modules).

## Timeline

### 2026-01-27 — Lock Holder Timeout Fix and Dead Code Removal

**What changed:**
1. Fixed critical bug: lock holder 24h timeout no longer releases locks when PID is still alive
2. Removed ~650 lines of dead code: `is_session_active()`, `find_by_cwd()`, redundant `normalize_path`
3. Updated stale v3→v4 documentation across state modules

**Why:**
- **Timeout bug**: Sessions running >24h would incorrectly have their locks released, causing state tracking to fail. The lock holder's safety timeout was unconditionally releasing locks instead of only when PID actually exited.
- **Dead code**: The codebase evolved from child→parent path inheritance (v3) to exact-match-only (v4), leaving orphaned functions and tests that no longer applied.
- **Stale docs**: Module docstrings still described v3 behavior (path inheritance, read-only store, hash-based locks).

**Agent impact:**
- Lock holder now tracks exit reason: only releases lock if `pid_exited == true`
- Functions removed: `is_session_active()`, `is_session_active_with_storage()`, `find_by_cwd()`, `boundaries::normalize_path()`
- Documentation in `store.rs`, `mod.rs`, `lock.rs`, `resolver.rs` now accurately describes v4 behavior
- Path matching is exact-match-only—don't implement child→parent inheritance

**Files changed:** `lock_holder.rs`, `sessions.rs`, `store.rs`, `boundaries.rs`, `lock.rs`, `mod.rs`, `resolver.rs`, `claude.rs`

**Commit:** `3d78b1b`

### 2026-01-26 — fs_err and tracing for Improved Debugging

**What changed:**
1. Replaced `std::fs` with `fs_err` in all production code (20 files)
2. Added `tracing` infrastructure with daily log rotation (7 days retention)
3. Migrated custom `log()` functions to structured `tracing` macros
4. Replaced `eprintln!` with `tracing::warn!/error!` throughout
5. Consolidated duplicate `is_pid_alive` into single export from `hud_core::state`
6. Added graceful stderr fallback if file appender creation fails

**Why:** Debugging hooks was difficult—errors like "Permission denied" lacked file path context. Custom `log()` functions were scattered and inconsistent. The `fs_err` crate enriches error messages with the file path, and `tracing` provides structured, configurable logging with automatic rotation.

**Agent impact:**
- Logs written to `~/.capacitor/hud-hook-debug.{date}.log` (daily rotation, 7 days)
- Log level configurable via `RUST_LOG` env var (default: `hud_hook=debug,hud_core=warn`)
- Use `fs_err as fs` import pattern in all new Rust files (see existing files for examples)
- `is_pid_alive` is now exported from `hud_core::state` — don't duplicate it
- Use structured fields with tracing: `tracing::debug!(session = %id, "message")`

**Files changed:** 23 files across `hud-core` and `hud-hook`, new `logging.rs` module

**Commit:** `f1ce260`

### 2026-01-26 — Rust Best Practices Audit

**What changed:**
1. Added `#[must_use]` to 18 boolean query functions to prevent ignored return values
2. Fixed `needless_collect` lint (use `count()` directly instead of collecting to Vec)
3. Removed unused `Instant` from thread-local sysinfo cache
4. Extracted helper functions in `handle.rs` for clearer event processing
5. Fixed ignored return value in `lock_holder.rs` (now logs success/failure)

**Why:** Code review identified patterns that could lead to bugs (ignored boolean returns) and unnecessary allocations (collecting iterators just to count).

**Agent impact:**
- Functions like `is_session_running()`, `has_any_active_lock()` are marked `#[must_use]`—compiler warns if return value is ignored
- When counting matches, use `.filter().count()` not `.filter().collect::<Vec<_>>().len()`
- Helper functions `is_active_state()`, `extract_file_activity()`, `tool_use_action()` in `handle.rs` encapsulate event processing logic

**Commit:** `35dfc56`

---

### 2026-01-26 — Security Audit: Unsafe Code and Error Recovery

**What changed:**
1. Added SAFETY comments to all `unsafe` blocks documenting invariants
2. `RwLock` poisoning in session cache now recovers gracefully instead of panicking
3. Added `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` to `patterns.rs` for static regex (documented)
4. Documented intentional regex capture group expects in `ideas.rs`

**Why:** Unsafe code needs clear documentation of safety invariants. Lock poisoning shouldn't crash the app—it should recover and continue.

**Agent impact:**
- All `unsafe` blocks must have `// SAFETY:` comments explaining why the operation is safe
- Use `unwrap_or_else(|_| cache.write().unwrap_or_else(...))` pattern for RwLock recovery
- Static regex compilation can use `expect()` with `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` at module level
- See `cwd.rs`, `lock_holder.rs`, `handle.rs` for canonical `// SAFETY:` comment format

**Commit:** `a28eee5`

---

### 2026-01-26 — Self-Healing Lock Management

**What changed:** Added multi-layered cleanup to prevent accumulation of stale lock artifacts:
1. `cleanup_orphaned_lock_holders()` kills lock-holder processes whose monitored PID is dead
2. `cleanup_legacy_locks()` removes MD5-hash format locks from older versions
3. Lock-holders have 24-hour safety timeout (`MAX_LIFETIME_SECS`)
4. Locks now include `lock_version` field for debugging

**Why:** Users accumulate stale artifacts when Claude crashes without SessionEnd, terminal force-quits, or app updates. The system relied on "happy path" cleanup—processes exiting gracefully—but real-world usage is messier.

**Agent impact:**
- `CleanupStats` now has `orphaned_processes_killed` and `legacy_locks_removed` fields
- Lock metadata includes `lock_version` (currently `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`)
- `run_startup_cleanup()` runs process cleanup **first** (before file cleanup) to prevent races
- Lock-holder processes self-terminate after 24 hours regardless of PID monitoring state

**Files changed:** `cleanup.rs` (process/legacy cleanup), `lock_holder.rs` (timeout), `lock.rs` (version), `types.rs` (LockInfo)

---

### 2026-01-26 — Session-Based Locks (v4) and Exact-Match-Only Resolution

**What changed:**
1. Locks keyed by `{session_id}-{pid}` instead of path hash (MD5)
2. Path matching uses exact comparison only—no child→parent inheritance
3. Sticky focus: manual override persists until user clicks different project
4. Path normalization handles macOS case-insensitivity and symlinks

**Why:**
- **Concurrent sessions**: Old path-hash locks created 1:1 path↔lock, so two sessions in same directory competed
- **Monorepo independence**: Child paths shouldn't inherit parent's state; packages track independently
- **Sticky focus**: Prevents jarring auto-switching between multiple active sessions

**Agent impact:**
- Lock files: `~/.capacitor/sessions/{session_id}-{pid}.lock/` (v4) vs `{md5-hash}.lock/` (legacy)
- `find_all_locks_for_path()` returns multiple locks (concurrent sessions)
- `release_lock_by_session()` releases specific session's lock
- Resolver's stale Ready fallback removed—lock existence is authoritative
- Legacy MD5-hash locks are stale and should be deleted

**Deprecated:** Path-based locks (`{hash}.lock`), child→parent inheritance, stale Ready fallback.

**Commits:** `97ddc3a`, `3e63150`

**Plan doc:** `.claude/plans/DONE-session-based-locking.md`

---

### 2026-01-26 — Bulletproof Hook System

**What changed:** Hook binary management now uses symlinks instead of copies, with auto-repair on failure.

**Why:** Copying adhoc-signed Rust binaries triggered macOS Gatekeeper SIGKILL (exit 137). Symlinks work reliably.

**Agent impact:**
- `~/.local/bin/hud-hook` must be a **symlink** to `target/release/hud-hook`
- Never copy the binary—always symlink
- See `scripts/sync-hooks.sh` for the canonical approach

**Commits:** `ec63003`

---

### 2026-01-25 — Status Chips Replace Prose Summaries

**What changed:** Replaced three-tier prose summary system (`workingOn` → `lastKnownSummary` → `latestSummary`) with compact status chips showing session state and recency.

**Why:** Prose summaries required reading and parsing. For rapid context-switching between projects, users need **scannable signals**, not narratives. A chip showing "🟡 Waiting · 2h ago" is instantly parseable.

**Agent impact:**
- Don't implement prose summary features—the pattern is deprecated
- Status chips are the canonical way to show project context
- Stats now refresh every 30 seconds to keep recency accurate
- Summary caching logic removed from project cards

**Deprecated:** Three-tier summary fallback, `workingOn` field, prose-based project context display.

**Commits:** `e1b8ed5`, `cca2c28`

---

### 2026-01-25 — Async Hooks and IDE Terminal Activation

**What changed:**
1. Hooks now use Claude Code's `async: true` feature to run in background
2. Setup card detects missing async configuration and prompts to fix
3. Clicking projects with shells in Cursor/VS Code activates the correct IDE window

**Why:**
- Async hooks eliminate latency impact on Claude Code (sidecar philosophy: observe without interfering)
- IDE support handles growing use case of integrated terminals vs standalone terminal apps

**Agent impact:**
- Hook config now includes `async: true` and `timeout: 30` for most events
- `SessionEnd` stays synchronous to ensure cleanup completes
- New `IDEApp` enum in `TerminalLauncher.swift` handles Cursor, VS Code, VS Code Insiders
- Setup card validation checks async config, not just hook existence

**Commits:** `24622a4`, `225a0d7`, `8c8debc`

---

### 2026-01-24 — Terminal Window Reuse and Tmux Support

**What changed:** Clicking a project reuses existing terminal windows instead of always launching new ones. Added tmux session switching and TTY-based tab selection.

**Why:** Avoid terminal window proliferation. Users typically want to switch to existing sessions, not create new ones.

**Agent impact:**
- `TerminalLauncher` now searches `shell-cwd.json` for matching shells before launching new terminals
- Supports iTerm, Terminal.app tab selection via AppleScript
- Supports kitty remote control for window focus
- Tmux sessions are switched via `tmux switch-client -t <session>`

**Commits:** `5c58d3d`, `bcfc5f9`

---

### 2026-01-24 — Shell Integration Performance Optimization

**What changed:** Rewrote shell hook to use native macOS `libproc` APIs instead of subprocess calls for process tree walking.

**Why:** Target <15ms execution time for shell precmd hooks. Subprocess calls (`ps`, `pgrep`) were too slow.

**Agent impact:** The `hud-hook cwd` command is now the canonical way to track shell CWD. Shell history stored in `~/.capacitor/shell-history.jsonl` with 30-day retention.

**Commits:** `146f2b4`, `a02c54d`, `a1d371b`

---

### 2026-01-23 — Plan File Audit and Compaction

**What changed:** Archived completed plans with `DONE-` prefix, compacted to summaries. Removed stale documentation.

**Why:** Keep `.claude/plans/` focused on actionable implementation plans.

**Agent impact:** When looking for implementation history, check `DONE-*.md` files for context. Git history preserves original detailed versions.

**Commit:** `052cecb`

---

### 2026-01-21 — Binary-Only Hook Architecture

**What changed:** Removed bash wrapper script for hooks, now uses pure Rust binary at `~/.local/bin/hud-hook`.

**Why:** Eliminate shell parsing overhead, improve reliability, reduce dependencies.

**Agent impact:** Hooks are installed via `./scripts/sync-hooks.sh`. The hook binary handles all Claude Code events directly.

**Deprecated:** Wrapper scripts, bash-based hook handlers.

**Commits:** `13ef958`, `6321e4d`

---

### 2026-01-20 — Bash to Rust Hook Migration

**What changed:** Migrated hook handler from bash script to compiled Rust binary (`hud-hook`).

**Why:** Performance (bash was too slow), reliability, better error handling.

**Agent impact:** Hook logic lives in `core/hud-hook/src/`. The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin/hud-hook`.

**Commit:** `c94c56b`

---

### 2026-01-19 — V3 State Detection Architecture

**What changed:** Adopted new state detection that uses lock file existence as authoritative signal. Removed conflicting state overrides.

**Why:** Lock existence + live PID is more reliable than timestamp freshness. Handles tool-free text generation where no hook events fire.

**Agent impact:** When debugging state detection, check `~/.capacitor/sessions/` for lock files. Lock existence = session active.

**Deprecated:** Previous state detection approaches that relied on timestamp freshness.

**Commits:** `92305f5`, `6dfa930`

---

### 2026-01-17 — Agent SDK Integration Removed

**What changed:** Removed experimental Agent SDK integration.

**Why:** Discarded direction—Capacitor is a sidecar, not an AI agent host.

**Agent impact:** Do not attempt to add Agent SDK or similar integrations. The app observes Claude Code, doesn't run AI directly.

**Commit:** `1fd6464`

---

### 2026-01-16 — Storage Namespace Migration

**What changed:** Migrated from `~/.claude/` to `~/.capacitor/` namespace for Capacitor-owned state.

**Why:** Respect sidecar architecture—read from Claude's namespace, write to our own.

**Agent impact:** All Capacitor state files are in `~/.capacitor/`. Claude Code config remains in `~/.claude/`.

**Key paths:**
- `~/.capacitor/sessions.json` — Session state
- `~/.capacitor/sessions/` — Lock directory
- `~/.capacitor/shell-cwd.json` — Active shell sessions
- `~/.capacitor/hud-hook-debug.{date}.log` — Debug logs (NEW)

**Commits:** `1d6c4ae`, `1edae7d`

---

### 2026-01-15 — Thinking State Removed

**What changed:** Removed deprecated "thinking" state from session tracking.

**Why:** Claude Code no longer uses extended thinking in a way that needs separate UI state.

**Agent impact:** Session states are: `Working`, `Ready`, `Idle`, `Compacting`, `Waiting`. No "Thinking" state.

**Commit:** `500ae3f`

---

### 2026-01-14 — Caustic Underglow Feature Removed

**What changed:** Removed experimental visual effect (underglow/glow).

**Why:** Design decision—cleaner UI without the effect.

**Agent impact:** Do not add back underglow or similar effects. The app uses subtle visual styling.

**Commit:** `f3826d5`

---

### 2026-01-13 — Daemon Architecture Removed

**What changed:** Removed background daemon process architecture.

**Why:** Simplified to foreground app with file-based state.

**Agent impact:** The app runs as a standard macOS app, not a daemon. State persistence is file-based.

**Deprecated:** Any daemon/background service patterns.

**Commit:** `1884e78`

---

### 2026-01-12 — Artifacts Feature Removed

**What changed:** Removed Artifacts feature, replaced with floating header with progressive blur.

**Why:** Artifacts was over-scoped. Simpler floating header serves the use case.

**Agent impact:** Do not add "artifacts" or similar content management features. The app focuses on session state and project switching.

**Commit:** `84504b3`

---

### 2026-01-10 — Relay Experiment Removed

**What changed:** Removed relay/proxy experiment.

**Why:** Discarded direction.

**Agent impact:** The app communicates directly with Claude Code via filesystem, not through relays.

**Commit:** `9231c39`

---

### 2026-01-07 — Tauri Client Removed, SwiftUI Focus

**What changed:** Removed Tauri/web client, focused entirely on native macOS SwiftUI app.

**Why:** Native performance, ProMotion 120Hz support, better macOS integration.

**Agent impact:** This is a SwiftUI-only project. No web technologies, no Tauri, no Electron.

**Commit:** `2b938e9`

---

### 2026-01-06 — Project Created

**What changed:** Initial commit, Rust + Swift architecture established.

**Why:** Build a native macOS dashboard for Claude Code power users.

**Agent impact:** Core architecture: Rust business logic + UniFFI + Swift UI.

---

## Trajectory

The project is moving toward:

1. **Parallel workstreams** — One-click git worktree creation for isolated parallel work
   - Architecture decisions locked: worktrees at `{repo}/.capacitor/worktrees/{name}/`
   - Identity model: workstreams are child entities under parent project (not top-level projects)
   - Source of truth: `git worktree list --porcelain`
   - Ready for implementation planning

2. **Project context signals** — ✅ Implemented as status chips (2026-01-25)

3. **Multi-agent CLI support** — Starship-style adapters for Claude, Codex, Aider, Amp (plan completed)

4. **Idea capture with LLM sensemaking** — Fast capture flow with AI-powered expansion (plan completed)

5. **Self-healing lock management** — ✅ Implemented (2026-01-26)
   - Orphaned process cleanup, legacy lock cleanup, 24h safety timeout, version tracking

6. **Improved debugging** — ✅ Implemented (2026-01-26)
   - `fs_err` for file path context in errors
   - `tracing` for structured logging with daily rotation
   - Consolidated shared utilities (e.g., `is_pid_alive`)

7. **Codebase cleanup** — ✅ Implemented (2026-01-27)
   - Removed ~650 lines of dead code from v3→v4 evolution
   - Fixed lock holder 24h timeout bug (no longer releases active sessions)
   - Updated stale documentation across state modules

The core sidecar architecture is stable. Recent focus: lock reliability (session-based, self-healing, timeout fix), exact-match path resolution for monorepos, terminal integration, and codebase hygiene (dead code removal, documentation accuracy).

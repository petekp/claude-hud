## January 2026

### Dock Mode Polish Sprint (Round 1)
- Restored mono font on project title (sectionTitle.monospaced)
- Bumped all typography up one step in the type scale
- Reduced card height by 20% (158→126px, dropped 4:3 ratio)
- Moved port pill under title; session summary to bottom
- Added elegant `.contentTransition(.interpolate)` when summary changes
- Removed transition on active session outline (now instant)

### Visual Polish Sprint 🎨
*Cohesive refinement pass for organic, flowing interface.*

- State change visual effects now fade in/out gracefully (0.4s easeInOut transitions for Ready border glow)
- Section headers ("IN PROGRESS", "PAUSED") use small caps treatment (10pt semibold, 1.2 tracking, uppercase)
- Paused section spacing fixed (wrapped in VStack with 0 spacing, dividers provide equidistant separation)
- Project card summary text more subtle (12pt regular, 60% opacity vs previous full white)
- Project card titles use monospace font (14pt medium monospaced)
- Ready sound refined to "wooden knock" character:
  - Warmer fundamental (680Hz vs 880Hz), inharmonic overtones (2.3x, 4.1x)
  - Fast percussive attack (3ms), exponential decay
  - Subtle noise burst for organic texture
  - Slight vibrato wobble for natural resonance

### Header UX Improvements
- Replaced remote sync button with "Add Project" button in header
- New button uses NSOpenPanel for native macOS folder picker
- Projects can now be added anytime (not just from empty state)

### State Resolver Matching Logic Refinement (8 Iterations)
**ADR:** `docs/architecture-decisions/002-state-resolver-matching-logic.md`

Comprehensive fixes to session state detection through iterative ChatGPT review:

**Core Changes:**
- Three-way matching: Exact > Child > Parent (removed sibling due to cross-project contamination risk)
- Root path matches any descendant (not just immediate children): `/` ↔ `/a/b/c` works
- Timestamp-based lock selection: when multiple locks share PID, picks newest by `started`
- PID-only fallback includes exact matches (not just children)
- Deterministic tie-breaker: freshness → match type → session_id

**Issues Fixed:**
1. Root special-case only matched immediate children (broke `/` ↔ `/foo/bar`)
2. PID-only lock matching nondeterministic (returned first match, not newest)
3. Sibling matching depth guard insufficient (still allowed cross-project contamination)
4. Exact locks excluded from PID-only search (could pair wrong lock)
5. Test helper used same timestamp (timestamp selection not validated)
6. Docstrings mentioned removed sibling matching

**Testing:**
- 94 tests passing (removed 3 sibling tests, added 2 root nesting tests)
- Test coverage for root ↔ nested paths, multi-lock scenarios, timestamp selection
- `create_lock_with_timestamp()` helper for deterministic tests

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ No cross-project contamination (safe)
- ✅ Deterministic behavior (reliable)
- ✅ Root nesting works (arbitrary depth)
- ❌ cd ../sibling won't match (must cd back to parent) - acceptable for safety

**Files Modified:**
- `core/hud-core/src/state/resolver.rs` - Matching logic, root special-cases
- `core/hud-core/src/state/lock.rs` - Timestamp selection, exact+child scanning
- Test helpers and comprehensive test coverage

### Projects View Polish Pass
- Session summary text changed to normal weight (was semibold)
- Section counts hidden when only 1 item (show "In Progress" not "In Progress (1)")
- Paused items polish: fixed height (no vertical growth on hover), balanced spacing, Revive button hover state
- Health badge moved from project cards to Project Details view (next to project title)
- Card→Paused transitions: auto-expand Paused section when project added; distinct view IDs ensure proper style switching
- Paused→Card transitions: distinct IDs ("active-{path}" vs "paused-{path}") for clean view replacement

### Projects View Simplification
- Consolidated three sections (Needs Input, In Progress, Paused) into two (In Progress, Paused)
- Removed summary bar from top of main view
- Left-aligned section headers with inline counts (e.g., "In Progress (3)")
- Made project titles more prominent (14pt semibold, 0.9 opacity)
- Removed animated dots from status indicator; just show text
- Removed comma from port numbers (show "3000" not "3,000")
- Added separators between project names in Paused section
- Removed time display from Paused rows; added "Revive" button on hover
- Re-implemented drag-and-drop sorting with persistent order
- Style transitions: card → row when moving to Paused, row → card when moving to In Progress

### Dark UI Polish Pass
- Border glow made thinner (0.75/1.25 lineWidth vs previous 1.5/2.5)

- Typography improvements: proper hierarchy (name 15px → working on 13px → next step 12px → stats 10px), color-coded states, tighter spacing
- Context tracking: hooks write state to centralized file, status line provides context %, real-time file watching

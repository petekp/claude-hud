# State Tracking Test Suite

Tests for the Claude Code session state tracking system. Run these tests whenever making changes to state tracking code.

## Components Under Test

1. **Hook Script** (`~/.claude/scripts/hud-state-tracker.sh`)
2. **Lock System** (`~/.claude/sessions/*.lock/`)
3. **Rust Core** (`core/hud-core/src/sessions.rs`)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all state tracking tests (recommended)
./tests/state-tracking/run-all.sh

# Run specific test suites
./tests/state-tracking/test-hook-events.sh      # Hook event handling (13 tests)
./tests/state-tracking/test-lock-system.sh      # Lock creation/cleanup (8 tests)
cargo test -p hud-core sessions::tests          # Rust unit tests (14 tests)
```

## Test Coverage Matrix

| ProjectStatus serialization | | | ✓ |

## Test Isolation

Tests use in-memory backup/restore to avoid corrupting the real `~/.capacitor/sessions.json`. The original state is captured before tests and restored after, even if tests fail.

## Prerequisites

- `jq` - JSON processor (install with `brew install jq`)
- `cargo` - Rust toolchain
- Hook script installed at `~/.claude/scripts/hud-state-tracker.sh`

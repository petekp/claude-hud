# TODO

## Goals
- Eliminate cognitive overhead of context-switching between projects
- Surface project context automatically (no manual tracking)
- Enable instant resume: see status at a glance → pick project → jump in with full context in seconds
- Optimize users' Claude Code experience by closing the gap between novice and expert setups

## High Priority

(none currently)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Dev environment automation: autostart dev server alongside Claude session, auto-detect port, add "open in browser" button. One-click to full working environment (Claude + terminal + browser).
- [ ] Explore: surface Claude's plan files (make visible and editable from HUD)
- [ ] Brainstorm: first-class todos feature — allow users to see and edit todos per project
- [ ] Brainstorm: potential uses for Claude Agent SDK — start by digesting official docs and popular tutorials

## Strategic (Larger Explorations)

- [ ] Exploratory session: rethink the IA of the main Projects view to best achieve the goal of managing many Claude Code projects in parallel. Leverage all relevant skills (design, UX, interaction design, etc.). Nothing off limits — platform choice is open too, though desktop presence likely needed
- [ ] Design "Claude Code Coach" capability: optimize users' Claude Code experience by detecting suboptimal setups and guiding improvements. Key areas: CLAUDE.md quality (goals, architecture, commands), plugin recommendations, hooks setup, usage pattern insights. Surface via health scores on project cards, onboarding wizard for new projects, and inline suggestions. Position HUD as an active enhancer, not just a viewer.

## Completed

- [x] Focused project detection: highlights the project card matching the currently focused terminal window
  - Backend polls frontmost app via AppleScript
  - Detects Warp, Terminal.app, iTerm2 working directories
  - Matches against pinned projects
  - Shows lighter background on focused card
- [x] UI polish pass: improved scannability and reduced visual noise
  - Working state: Claude-colored border (no animation), card not dimmed
  - Ready state: green pulsing glow border
  - "Your turn" label changed to "Ready"
  - Orange accent color replaced with neutral gray throughout
  - Project name font size increased from 13px to lg (18px)
  - Context usage indicator removed (not helpful)
- [x] Visual state indicators: animated borders (working=amber glow, ready=blue pulse, compacting=shimmer), color-coded state labels, context % display
- [x] Typography improvements: proper hierarchy (name 15px → working on 13px → next step 12px → stats 10px), color-coded states, tighter spacing
- [x] Context tracking: hooks write state to centralized file, status line provides context %, real-time file watching
- [x] Remove the Global tab and view entirely
- [x] Remove the Refresh button
- [x] Move Plugins into the Artifacts page as another tab
- [x] Fix project list badges readability in dark mode (now uses low alpha backgrounds, prominence matches state)
- [x] Add loading state when adding a new project (shows feedback during stats computation)
- [x] Terminal detection for play button: now detects existing terminals in project directory and focuses them instead of opening new ones (uses sysinfo crate for process detection, AppleScript for window focus)
